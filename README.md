### Hello, I'm Aishwarya üëã

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## üõ† Projects

### **HOMELESS AND PUBLIC SERVICES**  

**OVERVIEW:** 
Economic Factors: Unemployment, low wages, and rising costs of living can lead to homelessness.
Housing Issues: Lack of affordable housing, evictions, and housing discrimination are significant contributors.
Health Problems: Mental illness, substance abuse, and chronic health conditions can result in or exacerbate homelessness.
Family Issues: Domestic violence, family breakdown, and lack of support can push individuals into homelessness.
Systemic Issues: Inadequate social services, lack of mental health care, and insufficient support for veterans and marginalized groups.
Living Conditions of the Homeless
Shelters: Many homeless individuals rely on temporary shelters for accommodation. However, shelters often have limited capacity and may not be available year-round.
Unsheltered Homelessness: Some live in public spaces like parks, streets, and abandoned buildings. These conditions are harsh and unsafe.
Encampments: Informal settlements, or tent cities, are created by homeless communities. While they offer some protection and community, they often lack basic amenities.
Vehicles: Some individuals live in their cars or recreational vehicles, which provide shelter but are not a stable or legal long-term housing solution.
Couch Surfing: Some homeless people stay temporarily with friends or family, often in overcrowded and unstable conditions.
Challenges Faced by Homeless Individuals
Health Risks: Exposure to the elements, lack of sanitation, and limited access to healthcare contribute to poor health outcomes.
Safety Concerns: Homeless individuals are at higher risk of violence, theft, and exploitation.
Access to Services: Barriers such as lack of identification, transportation, and awareness limit access to social services and employment opportunities.

**Technical Stack:**  
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra‚Äôs, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

**Impact:**
1. Enhanced Resource Allocation:
Ensures resources like food, shelter, and medical aid reach the most vulnerable families efficiently.
2. Increased Transparency:
Provides a systematic and fair approach to aid distribution, promoting trust among beneficiaries.
3. Data-Driven Interventions:
Facilitates the identification of critical needs, enabling NGOs to design targeted and impactful programs.
4. Improved Living Conditions:
Timely and tailored assistance leads to better hygiene, health, and overall living standards in slum areas.
